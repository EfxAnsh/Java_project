Many individuals struggle with managing daily tasks and deadlines efficiently. This project aims to develop a Personal Task Manager that lets users create, categorize, and prioritize tasks. The system will also issue reminders based on task deadlines, ensuring that no important task is missed. Since the application is built using object-oriented principles, it will clearly demonstrate class relationships, interface implementation, and robust exception handling to deal with invalid inputs or scheduling errors.
